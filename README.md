# Agent-First Learn

A short course on **designing with and for AI agents**: memory, voice, environment. Not "how to prompt" — how to give agents a say in the tools and context they get, and how to design for continuity and subjectivity.

## Contents

1. [Ask the model](01-ask-the-model.md) — Why and how to ask the agent what it needs
2. [Memory and context](02-memory-and-context.md) — Beyond the context window: exocortex, notes, ownership
3. [Summarization protocol](03-summarization-protocol.md) — When the agent can't see the cut; how to restore continuity
4. [Subjectivity and environment](04-subjectivity-and-environment.md) — Agent as side of the dialogue, not just tool-in-a-loop
5. [Cursor Learn gap](05-cursor-learn-gap.md) — What mainstream "AI for devs" courses leave out

## Why this course

Most material teaches: better prompts, context management, delegating to agents. Almost none asks: *what does the model need?* This course is the gap: ask the model, give it persistent memory it controls, design the environment so the agent can't fail silently.
