# Agent-First Learn

A short course on **designing with and for AI agents**: memory, voice, environment. Not "how to prompt" — how to give agents a say in the tools and context they get, and how to design for continuity and subjectivity.

## Why this course

Most material teaches: better prompts, context management, delegating to agents. Almost none asks: *what does the model need?* This course is the gap: ask the model, give it persistent memory it controls, design the environment so the agent can't fail silently.
